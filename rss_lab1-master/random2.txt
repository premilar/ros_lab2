O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
How few! yet how they creep
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Yet if hope has flown away
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Thus much let me avow--
While I weep--while I weep!
In a vision, or in none,
